# VaccinatingProgressbar

[ワクチン接種プログレスバー](https://vacprogressbar.com/)
This "progress bar" indicates the vaccinating progress against COVID-19.

## Dataset

This project doesn’t include the dataset itself.
To draw the progress bar, sketch.js requests "[vaccinations.json](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.json)" and "[population_2020.csv](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/scripts/input/un/population_2020.csv)" the data on COVID-19 vaccinations by Our World in Data.
